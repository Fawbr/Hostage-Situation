  dialogue:
  - Taking in your surroundings, you identify yourself to be in an old theatre, abandoned.
  - The wooden floorboards beneath you and giant red curtains place you in the role
    of an actor on the stage.
  - The masked figure finally steps forward, and for a moment you're completely unable
    to distinguish his intent.
  - His body twists and deforms, snapping to attention like each muscle, each bone
    was being commanded to move individually, untethered from the rest of its flesh
    and sinew.
  - Like a puppet being jerked around on a string. For a moment you question whether
    or not this thing was even human.
  - As if to answer your suspicions, it speaks.
  - '"Ah--! Finally, you''re awake!"'
  - '"You must be a little confused, I suppose I should handle introductions!"'
  - '"I am the one and only Mysteryman Extraordinaire! I do apologise, have I frightened
    you? That won''t do... that won''t do... I thought you''d operate easier under
    situations of stress!"'
  - For someone holding you hostage, the 'Mysteryman Extraordinaire' spoke with an
    awfully jovial tone. It's hands drummed at its side awkwardly for a moment before
    speaking again.
  - '"Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea perhaps? I need you in as good of a state
    as possible before we start this interview, after all!"'
