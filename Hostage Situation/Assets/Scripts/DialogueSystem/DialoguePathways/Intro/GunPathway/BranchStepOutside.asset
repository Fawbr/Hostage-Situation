  dialogue:
  - '"Yes... yes, I just... need to step outside for a moment."'
  - '"Stay there, I won''t be a moment."'
  - Perhaps the masked figure found such a comment amusing, considering you were
    bound to your chair with rope.
  - The moment they stepped behind the curtains you started to struggle against your
    restraints, pushing against the ropes that bound your body with all your strength.
  - You let out a shaky sigh of relief as the ropes loosen just enough to give you
    the slightest luxury of movement.
  - Unfortunately, your relief is short lived as the masked figure returns, and you
    realise that if you'd like to attempt escape, you'll need to wait for the perfect
    moment to do so.
  - '"Alright! Where were we?"'
