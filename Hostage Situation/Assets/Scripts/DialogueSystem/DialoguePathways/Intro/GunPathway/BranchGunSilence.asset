  dialogue:
  - You weren't an idiot, and so you quickly understood your situation and buried
    down the rising panic that burrowed through your systen.
  - After a few seconds of silence, the masked figure sighs and finally puts the
    gun away, allowing you to breathe and choke down gasps of air.
  - '"... right, where were we"?'
  - It takes a second for the masked figure to recuperate themselves, angry at having
    revealed the "ace up their sleeve".
  - '"I suppose there''s little point in dragging this out now. You will perform
    an interview, a good interview."'
  - '"If you fail to do so, I''ll kill you and find someone else."'
  - '"... agh! You''ve ruined this already! I''ve got to try and... recover now!
    It''s awfully difficult to keep a happy face when you''re staring at me with
    such... contempt!!"'
