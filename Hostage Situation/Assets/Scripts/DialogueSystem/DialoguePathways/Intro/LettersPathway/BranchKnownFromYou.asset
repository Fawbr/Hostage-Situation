  dialogue:
  - Moments away from death you plead your case in regards to the the masked figure's
    identity.
  - Seconds pass, stretching out the uncertainty of your life across agonising moments,
    until finally...
  - '"Yes... yes I suppose... I suppose a direct approach would have been better."'
  - The metal pressed against your forehead is finally removed as the gun disappears
    back into the figure's trenchcoat.
  - '"After all, those letters could have come from some... some madman!"'
  - '"I should have reassured you that wasn''t the case, that you were safe in my
    hands..."'
  - '"I apologise, I shouldn''t have acted so rash! Let us begin the interview, hm?"'
