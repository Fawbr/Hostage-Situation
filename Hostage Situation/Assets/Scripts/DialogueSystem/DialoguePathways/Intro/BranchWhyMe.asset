  dialogue:
  - The masked madman attempts to stifle a laugh at your comment, ultimately failing
    to do so as they erupt into a fit of giggles.
  - '"Wh.. what are you talking about? This is good for the both of us!"'
  - '"Someone has to interview yours truly, and you''re the perfect one for it!"'
  - '"I even made sure to schedule a time, allocate a location, and now here we are!"'
  - '"It''s all in the letters I sent you!"'
  - Your mind jumps back as your stomach lurches. A nausea overwhelms you as everything
    clicks.
  - Piles of letters, a demand for an interview...
  - Perhaps you should have read more than just the first before throwing the whole
    thing aside.
