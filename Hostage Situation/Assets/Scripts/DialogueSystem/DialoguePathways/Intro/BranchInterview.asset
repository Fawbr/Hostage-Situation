  dialogue:
  - The figure's head jerks slightly to the left as they peer at you.
  - It's almost impossible to tell the expression hidden underneath, and they murmur
    something under their breath as they slowly begin to approach you, now curious.
  - '"Did you not <color=red>receive my letters?"'
  - Your mind jumps back as your stomach lurches. A nausea overwhelms you as everything
    finally clicks.
  - Piles of latters, a demand for an interview...
  - Perhaps you should have read more than just the first letter before throwing
    the whole thing aside.
