  dialogue:
  - As you open your mouth to speak you find yourself crying out in pain, your whole
    body lurches forward as an iron hot burning sensations embeds itself in your
    skin.
  - Your thoughts were rendered null as you became able to focus on nothing but the
    searing agony in your leg.
  - Through hazy vision your eyes settle upon a smoking barrel, and the pieces click.
  - '"We''ll edit that out in post..."'
  - '"Do I have to make it any clearer to you? I''m not playing games."'
  - '"Let''s try this again, hm?"'
