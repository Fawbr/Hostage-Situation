  dialogue:
  - '"I-- you..."'
  - '"That was not a question I was expecting..."'
  - '"I will indulge you just this once... but if you toe the line again, you will
    find yourself regretting it."'
  - Another pause. Blanc squirms in their seat for a moment, and you can't help but
    gain a slight sense of satisfaction watching this madman feel even a fraction
    of the level of stress you've endured thus far.
  - '"Anonymity is freeing. I can be whoever I want to be, say whatever I want to
    say, and there''s no worries or anxieities that come with it!"'
  - '"There''s no greater feeling than being remade from the ground up. Casting aside
    who you once were, to be born anew as something more fantastic than you ever
    could be!"'
  - '"I could be anybody. Every time you pass a person on the street, every time
    you talk to your local cashier. I could be that person, and you''d never know."'
  - '"But you''d always suspect."'
  - Your heart lurches into your stomach for a moment, the sinisterness of Blanc's
    tone hinting towards some sort of depravity you hadn't yet thought of. If you
    manage to escape alive... will that really be the end of it?
  - Sensing the lull in conversation, Blanc awkwardly coughs for a moment before
    picking up the slack once again.
  - '"And it makes for an interesting personality! Everybody wants to know, it''s
    why we love murder mysteries, detective cases, so on and so forth."'
  - '"Why wouldn''t you want to be the most engaging person you can be?"'
