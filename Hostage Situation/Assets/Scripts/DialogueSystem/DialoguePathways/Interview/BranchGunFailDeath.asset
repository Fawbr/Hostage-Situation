  - '"... I''ve spent all this time, all this work..."'
  - '"I''ve been so merciful, I have!"'

    in their place. '
  - 'Perhaps this was your hell. Forced to indulge in the fantasies of a screaming,
    tantruming psychopath. '
  - However, such thoughts were left to when you were a thinking, breathing person,
    instead of a lifeless object.

  - GAME OVER.
