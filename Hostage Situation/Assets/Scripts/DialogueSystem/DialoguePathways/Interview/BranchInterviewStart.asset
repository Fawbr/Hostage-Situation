  dialogue:
  - Disappearing behind the curtains for a moment, the Mysteryman Extraordinaire
    reappears with a camera and a chair. After hitting record on the camera, they
    quckly plop themselves down on the chair, now placed opposite from you.
  - '"Welcome ladies and gentleman and those that exist in the technicolour rainbow
    inbetween!"'
  - '"I''m the one and only Mysteryman Extraordinaire, but you can call me Blanc
    for short!"'
  - Well that's good, if you had to refer to 'Blanc' as their awfully long title
    throughout this interview you might've gone crazy.
  - '"... and I''m so glad you could join us all for the show!"'
  - '"Let''s get a word in from the audience!"'
  - '"... anyway, the floor is yours journalist!"'
