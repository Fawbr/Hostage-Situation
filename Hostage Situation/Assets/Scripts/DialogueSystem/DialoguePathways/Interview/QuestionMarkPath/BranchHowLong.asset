  dialogue:

  - Clearing their throat, Blanc laughs awkwardly to your question, drumming his
    fingers against his leg as he attempts to answer.
  - '"Ah I suppose... well, I suppose everyone has an expiry date."'
  - '"Hah! I''m hoping at least twenty years, that feels like a good amount of time
    to exist within the public eye."'
  - '"Though I''d like to be timeless, even when I''m no longer capable of performing
    the old song and dance."'
  - '"A masked enigma can dream!"'
