  dialogue:
  - '"Partly! Everyone loves a good suspense story, after all! Once we finish this
    interview and I disappear from sight once again, I''ll have the whole world looking
    for me!"'
  - '"If it goes well enough, I might find myself repeating it!"'
  - '"Ooh, we could create our own talk show, I could come on for weekly appearances
    and answer questions from my adoring fans!"'
  - '"You wouldn''t mind hosting, would you? I''ll promise to patch you up if you
    get shot!"'
  - '... it probably wasn''t a good idea to tell Blanc that running a talk show for
    his insanities is probably the one thing you would mind the most right now. '
  - Even with any incredibly generous offers to patch you up, repeating this nightmare
    scenario wasn't all too high up on your bucket list.
