  dialogue:
  - Blanc seems to perk up a bit at your question, leaning forwardi n their chair
    and placing their hands on their knees before they start parroting out a response.
  - '"A fanbase? Ho ho! Well, since you asked..."'
  - '"I frequent some sites online, and people like to take photos of me as I walk
    across the street!"'
  - '"... though usually the cameras don''t roll until I start screaming, but after
    that I achieve easy virality!"'
  - An image of the Mysteryman Extraordinaire harassing some poor old woman on the
    streets hits your mind, and for a second it's difficult to compare that image
    with the gun-toting psychopath sat across from you.
  - ... did something change?
