  dialogue:
  - Your lie hangs in the air for a moment, a misdirection in an attempt to disguise
    the reality that would've likely sat your kidnapper into a frenzy.
  - They look at you, head tilting even further as they attempt to parse your sentence
    and decipher it's truth.
  - Silence falls between the two of you, and hten the Mysteryman Extraordinaire
    carefully begins to question you.
  - '"You... never received my letters?"'
  - '"I... how strange. I could have sworn..."'
  - '"Ack, I''m so certain I sent it to the right address! That damned receptionist
    of yours... they must''ve--!"'
  - You get the awful feeling that you might have accidentally set your masked kidnapper
    a new target after this 'interview'.
  - For the time being at least, it seems the Mysteryman Extraordinaire bought your
    lie.
  - '"I''m so sorry! You''ve not been prepared at all for this, then..."'
  - '"That explains everything, right down to the awkward way you''ve been squirming
    around in your seat!"'
  - '"Let me explain then... because of your reports of journalistic prowess and
    your status within the network, I was hoping you''d be willing to sit down to
    interview yours truly!"'
  - '"Oh you must''ve been so frightened when you woke up, poor thing!"'
  - '"I hope you''re still willing to continue with our interview?"'
  - They make a movement to pull something out of their pocket, and any words of
    refusal get caught in your throat as your eyes settle upon a revolver held in
    their hand.
  - Any concern coming from this... masked madman was nothing more than a faux attempt
    to be polite, and you felt it in your best interests to keep them appeased if
    you'd like to leave with your life.
  - You nod your head to them.
  - '"Good, good! Let''s begin, then."'
