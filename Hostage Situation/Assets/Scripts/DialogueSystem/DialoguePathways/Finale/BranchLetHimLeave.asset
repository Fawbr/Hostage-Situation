  dialogue:
  - Anger wells up in your system as you watch the Mysteryman Extraordinaire start
    to leave. Part of you wants to scream, to fight, to do anything in order to deliver
    some well earned justice to the psychopath who's held you hostage all this time.
  - But you can't muster up the courage, the threat of death looms over your head
    and you find yourself unable to do anything to stop him.
  - Blanc didn't lie however, the authorities did eventually come to collect you,
    and after weeks of investigation and interrogation, unfortunately no suspect
    was found to identify Blanc.
  - Eventually you were sent a copy of your 'interview', which was hardly different
    from the experience you endured. Even moments where you were threatened or harmed
    remained on camera, perhaps in order to cause more virality.
  - 'It might''ve been your obsessive scrolling, or your relation to the interview
    itself, but you saw as it exploded online. '
  - People were horrified, but at the same time they were enraptured by the interview,
    and people began theorising on the identity of who Blanc truly was.
  - It took weeks until you were able to muster up the courage to leave your house,
    and everytime you passed by a stranger, or exchanged words with a cashier, you
    were left with the wandering question of whether or not they might've been him.
  - You, too, had become caught up in the mystery of it all. Until one day, as you're
    walking through the street, you hear a voice from behind you, and a hand on your
    shoulder.
  - '"Hello journalist!~ How''s about an encore?"'
