  dialogue:
  - You were still bound to your chair, unable to get up and physically prevent Blanc
    from leaving. Though your physical restraints don't stop the venom that comes
    pouring from your mouth as you start to speak.
  - '"No."'
  - 'Hatred boils up from the deepest parts of your soul, and in a surge of anger
    you look through everything said, everything spoken, in an attempt to finally
    tear this bastard piece by piece. '
  - Even if it'll kill you.
  - Even if these are the last words you ever speak.
  - He cannot leave here untarnished.
