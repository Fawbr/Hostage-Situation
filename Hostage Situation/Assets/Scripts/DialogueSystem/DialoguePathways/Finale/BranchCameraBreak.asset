  dialogue:
  - In a fit of rage, you pry the camera from Blanc and stamp it underneath your
    foot, much to the desperate cries of the Mysteryman Extraordinaire.
  - 'Afterwards, you wait for the authorities to arrive. Upon doing so, you explain
    your situation and both you and Blanc are taken into custody. '
  - While they sympathised with your case, your kidnapping case unfortunately didn't
    hold much ground due to a lack of physical evidence to imply as such.
  - While Blanc is arrested for the crime of kidnapping and carrying an armed weapon,
    they're unable to find anything particularly concrete, and as a result he wound
    up facing a lighter sentence than what was properly deserved.
  - Meaning it would only be a matter of time before he found himself back on the
    streets, looking for another dream interview.
  - 
  - 'ENDING (6/8): NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE'
