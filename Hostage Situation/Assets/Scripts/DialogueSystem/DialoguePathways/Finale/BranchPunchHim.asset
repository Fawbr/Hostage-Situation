  dialogue:
  - In one defiant cry you raise your fist and bring it crashing down on Blanc's
    skull, halting their ability to raise their gun against you.
  - Then you hit him again...
  - ... and again...
  - ... and again.
  - Your fists become smeared with red as the purple and whites of Blanc's mask become
    stained with crimson, his body shudders with each impact, jolting from the sheer
    force of each punch.
  - In your rage you don't notice as he finally manages to point the gun and fires.
  - Everything goes dark, and by the time you come to you're awake in a hospital,
    being tended to by doctors.  Luckily, your wounds will heal, but it takes you
    time to build up the courage to face the public after your run-in with Blanc.
  - Luckily, your wounds will heal, but it takes you time to build up the courage
    to face the public after your run-in with Blanc.
  - 'He never did upload the interview. Or if he did it never picked up enough traction
    for you to notice. '
  - 'He might have escaped, or he might have been caught, you would never know. But
    you''re not afraid, you remember the violence you were capable of inflicting
    upon your captor. '
  - Perhaps part of you was eager for the opportunity to try again.
