  dialogue:
  - Having loosened your restraints earlier, you leap out from the rope much to the
    surprise of Blanc, who doesn't have time to turn around before you're already
    on top of him, knocking him to the ground.
  - The two of you struggle, but you quickly notice that physically you're much stronger
    than Blanc was, and you quickly begin to overpower him.
  - During the conflict however, Blanc manages to pull out his gun and starts trying
    to aim it towards you.
