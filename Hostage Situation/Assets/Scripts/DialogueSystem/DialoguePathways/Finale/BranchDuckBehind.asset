  dialogue:
  - To avoid the gunfire, you throw yourself behind some curtains and pray that none
    make contact with you. Luckily due to your smart thinking, you manage to escape
    unharmed.
  - Unfortunately, when the gunfire resides and you poke your head around the curtain,
    Blanc is nowhere to be seen.
  - Eventually, the authorities arrive, and after hours of questioning and interrogation,
    you're released back into the world.
  - 'The interview never airs, but you always find yourself waiting for the moment
    it might. '
  - You lose countless hours of sleep to that dread, and every face you walk across
    the street you're reminded that Blanc might be out there, waiting for a follow
    up interview.
