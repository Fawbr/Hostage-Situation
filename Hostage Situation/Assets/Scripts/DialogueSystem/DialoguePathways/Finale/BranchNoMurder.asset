  dialogue:
  - You manage to quell such awful thoughts.
  - Having now physically overpowered Blanc, you simply restrain him and wait for
    the authorities to arrive, deciding not to act on baser instincts or the rage
    pounding in your system.
  - When they arrive you give your statement, and with the evidence of your 'interview'
    the police are both able to destroy the footage and stop it from airing, while
    also having enough evidence to put Blanc away for a long time.
  - Allowing you to live without fear of the Masked Madman returning to repeat the
    events of that day once again.
  - 
  - 'ENDING 8/8: NO ENCORE.'
