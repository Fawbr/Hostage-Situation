  dialogue:
  - Deciding to gamble it all on this final moment, you charge straight for Blanc
    with fury dancing in your eyes. Blanc aims their pistol straight at you and fires.
  - 'Unfortunately, in your rage you forgot your wounded state, and as you attempt
    to dodge the bullet you find yourself collapsing from applying too much pressure
    to your injured leg. '
  - Your whole body lurches, and the bullet embeds itself deep in your stomach, causing
    you to drop and your body to hit the ground.
  - 'Everything goes dark, and by the time you come to you''re awake in a hospital,
    being tended to by doctors. '
  - Luckily, your wounds will heal, but it takes you time to build up the courage
    to face the public after your run-in with Blanc.
  - 'He never did upload the interview. Or if he did it never picked up enough traction
    for you to notice. '
  - 'But you still find yourself waiting for when he''ll reappear, and when you close
    your eyes, you can still see yourself back in the theatre, staring down the barrel
    of a gun. '
  - You survived, and that fact alone was at least enough to ease some of your comfort.
  - 
  - 'ENDING (2/8): INTERVIEW STATIC.'
