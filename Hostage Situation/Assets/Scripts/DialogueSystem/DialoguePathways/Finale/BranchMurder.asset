  dialogue:
  - Consumed by your rage, you allow such thoughts to drive your actions.
  - In one defiant cry you raise your fist and bring it crashing down on Blanc's
    skull, halting their ability to raise their gun against you.
  - Then you hit him again...
  - ... and again...
  - ... and again.
  - Your fists become smeared with red as the purple and whites of Blanc's mask become
    stained with crimson, his body shudders with each impact, jolting from the sheer
    force of each punch.
  - 'Until eventually, the Masked Mystery stopped moving. '
  - Their personhood reduced to a bloody, bludgeoned pile of meat.
  - When the police arrive, they take you under custody and charge you for the murder
    of an unnamed 'John Doe'.
  - 'You plead guilty during trial. You''re charged for manslaughter with a reduced
    sentence considering your situation. '
  - You never found out if the interview went live. Not that it would matter anymore
    if it did.
