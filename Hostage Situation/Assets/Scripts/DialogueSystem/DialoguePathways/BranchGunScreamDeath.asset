  dialogue:
  - Maybe it wasn't a good idea to scream after having been just warned not to.
  - The Masked Figure made good on their promise, and as you wailed at them yo spare
    your life, you found your sentence cut off midway through as your head lulled
    forward and red filled your vision.
  - Perhaps next time a bit more cautioun would be advised.
  - 
  - GAME OVER
